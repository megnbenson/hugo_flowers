##
Description of the club night - ‘Clubs are refracted spaces, experienced by their visitors as serving a spectrum of functions. They are places to converge and meld bodies into dance monstrosities. They are the site of introspection, of a mindful hedonism, for an individual alone in a smoking area. Or else they are safe spaces, a room in which to comfortably self destruct.

In-grid collective gathers a group of artists, musicians and creative technologists to share work about the transmutational potential of the club venue. In-grid.RealBodies is an evening which takes advantage of the multiplicity of Corsica Studios, a respected venue in London’s Elephant and Castle.'

The piece I exhibited was a collaboration with computational artists George Simms and Yasmin Morgan. We were thinking about extraction processes and the physical/ human sides of extraction that is needed with AI. Using Kate Crawford's Atlas of AI as a guiding point, we started sculpting blender models of mining, proccessing and the output of resources. Contemplating the ethos of 'more', seen in the current political war in the ukraine to the billionaire space race to leave the planet in search of more. Always looking externally as opposed to inwardly, using what we have and processing our waste. This resource became the 'gloop' that features in most of the models, filtering through the modular pipelines, using a randomised function to have a different combination of models each time, processing of gloop continues.
