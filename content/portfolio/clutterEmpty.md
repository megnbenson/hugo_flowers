##
This was a piece reflecting on contrasting states of mind. The piece landed on the two extremes of the mind, to me to have a cluttered mind is confusing and frustrating and with it, there's a difficulty to concentrate. Whereas the other extreme is being thoughtless, your thoughts are safely tucked away, organised in their respective drawers and cupboards, but with that comes a lack of focus too, a potential loss of reality, hence the representation of 'I' in the tidy mind is part of the walls. Appearing quite ghostly.

Head based on foundation course mate [Simon](https://www.instagram.com/kathman_dude/).
