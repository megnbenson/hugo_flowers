Documentation for Flower - Degree Show adapted project 2020

Concise Description
==================


* A project statement on the concept

This is a piece that examines structures. The viewer is invited to see the blossom branch that has rebalanced its focus: the petals stripped, the cogs turning freely and visibly. Each part works to fulfill the opening and closing, the soft routines to the sun. In this sense, one can look past the usual flash of petals to shed more light on the working parts that support the whole. This concept has amalgamated from reflecting on my own social circles, where it is easy to be distracted by flash, rather than helping those who support you. In lockdown its become clear I am living in a society where those (myself included) who profit off a biased system are distracted by the accompanying benefits, rather than caring for those who are critical to maintaining our local/national/global structures, overlooked, most at risk. The piece aims to create a moment of reflection as the flowers bloom.

* its adaptation

Initially the piece sprung from my final piece of second year - Beyond the Depths, looking at value and human transcendance and flowers as symbolism to that. Conceptually I was following threads from my dissertation on the care lacking for maintenance workers who are crucial to our structures online and offline, but are often outsourced so not given enough rights or pay. I was envisioning a big tree pre-lockdown, and had just tweaked the 3D print design to optimise the flower creation when the labs closed. Without the lab, the ideas for scaling were halted and more makeshift tools/ materials had to be acrued, but otherwise the piece didn't need too much adapting.

* how it could have been in a gallery
In a gallery I was envisioning a tree, or at least many branches from a wall, spotlit and quiet. I could also livestream it in an online exhibition, spotlit and blooming on the hour.

Potential Audience Engagement
==================

Audience engagement need not be flashy, the piece is not interactive with the viewer. It is there for speculation. The lack of external noise amplifies the motor turning the cogs and teeth. The film is there for context, but not crucial.

*What were you trying to communicate to your audience?
To present a system where all parts can be seen. To speculate whether we can have a similar social system.
*How might a presentation to affect them?
?
*How would you expect them to respond to/interact with your work?
perhaps drawn in my the motion of the piece,

## Iteration - Tell us the story of how you created the work:
------------------

I decided to present the documentation chronologically so that conceptual themes, material progress and design iteration can be seen to build. All pictures are taken by me unless otherwise stated.

# **Sept 2019** 

_Creative Research_ Starting with BioDesign Now, where two pieces caught my eye - [Lovely Trash](https://www.opencell.bio/ldf/lovely-trash) using discarded coffee cups to 3D print with mycelium, and Petra Ritzer's [Material Legacy](https://www.opencell.bio/ldf/material-legacy), a piece comparing degradation lifespans of different materials. She used wekinator and a webcam to detect which material the visitor put in front of it, to project the lifespan on the wall. Both these pieces furthered conceptual thought patterns around art-making and the materials that we choose to do so. Also just general materials that we have in our environments, at the time I had been (and still am)hoarding the plastic packaging that can't be recycled, as if it was going into landfill anyway I might as well hold onto the responsibility for it and keep it in my home. More on this later.

_Planning, Iteration_ **Oct 2019** 

Initially for the start of the year my goals were to work on multiple pieces, continuously be making so when the time came to it working on the final piece would be natural and not a rush - [blog post](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/188480781468). For the most part I succeeded in this goal, but not in the way I envisioned.
I started with the aim to recreate the flower piece that I did last year but focus on function, as 2019's piece broke on the opening night. Planning to create a delicate wire flower that would open and when it was at full bloom it would light up an LED in the centre.

# **Oct 2019** 

_Creative Research_ Simultaneously to the flower prototyping, I started work on _Magnet Man_. After being inspired by going to the magnetic artist [Takis](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/takis-2019/introducing-takis) exhibition at the Tate Modern - [blog post here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/188480784988/photos-from-the-takis-exhibition-at-tate-modern). Takis inspired me on many levels - his pieces are kinetic, similar to what I have been creating, but his work was from the 1960s making his work, which was harnessing magnetic energy and using electricity to give them eerie yet endearing qualities, at the cutting edge of the time.

{{< /figure >}}

_Technical research, Aesthetic Choices_ This exhibition led to planning a sculpture in response, a person in reflection, tapping an earring. A small gesture, a tic, an action occurring when the brain is too occupied to keep a real check of the physical. I explored terracotta air dry clay for this prototype with thoughts that I would create the sculpture in real kiln clay, taking inspiration from Takis' people sculptures above.

_Technical research, Planning_ Flower progress was slow as my previous design was very clunky, this lead to initial CAM follower Automaton [research](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tinkering_studio/14794136427).

_Creative research_ William Blake exhibition, at the [tate britain](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/william-blake-artist). Blakes work was captivating in a different way to Takis', each painting or print was often filled with anguish, the colour or forms splashing with emotion. Here offered inspiration for linos that would manifest themselves during lockdown.

_Technical research, development_ Using a makeshift cam-follower automaton and a tenuous LED circuit, further development, using maleable thick pipe cleaners instead of jewellery wire.[blog post link to video of it working](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/620994006672900096) - I quite like the manual interaction that you have with an automaton, there is a certain nuance to it where the user can feel the aches and bumps of the turning axel

# **Nov 2019**
_Technical research, development, reflection_  To mark the beginning of a new month, I did [some reflections](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/188652475973/questions-to-prompt-and-guide-flower-and-tapping) for the two pieces. Then material tests for petals of the flower, after looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47ILIYV9E3A) I decided to do some PVA tests, they did not work very well. At all. 

{{< figure class="grid two" figcaption="material testing" >}}

_Technical research, planning_ Further planning and iterations of clay and flower. Following [this tutorial](https://www.bc-robotics.com/tutorials/controlling-a-solenoid-valve-with-arduino/?fbclid=IwAR2gXahgHDqbx2eDo6tCJ_JEH_WjZVpMrnvKmL1IzZ3yBoPMhBqtuKJxypk) to try and get some electromagnets solenoids working after talking to Rob in the lab - [blog post here.](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/188744696992/tapping-man-sculpture-update-yesterday-bumped)

_Technical research, development_ following more tutorials for the magnets - I was struggling with the reversing polarities - as I wanted the finger to be repelled as well as attracted back to tap - and the strength of the electromagnets themselves. [Blog Post](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/188902627583/art-meganbenson-saw-this-video-below-followed) to show the motors with different polarities (eventually it turned out that the solenoids don't have a reverse). I also used the lasercutter to cut out a case for the cam to make it look cleaner - [blog post for video of that](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/188902640633/art-meganbenson-flower-progress-is-going-swell).

# **Dec 2019**
_Creative Research, technical research_ December was full steam ahead for dissertation, conceptually my head was deep in the work of [**Mierle Laderman Ukeles**](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/mierle-laderman-ukeles-new-york-city-sanitation-department.html). Before breaking for christmas however, my lab time was tackling electromagnets blog posts [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/189188620643/cant-work-it-out-got-two-electomagnets-working) [here, for video of motors](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/189571564376/motor-and-magnetic-led-motor-to-show-when-magnet) and [here,for video of motors](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/189571579020/motors-alternating-from-last-post), mainly frustrated at attraction but [lack of repelling](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/189571672363/update-with-electromagnet-circuit-got-a-better).
*Ukeles* was a major influence conceptually for the finished flowers piece, her work delved into the value and appreciation we give to maintenance workers, and how they are brushed to the sidelines of society when really maintenance should be celebrated. These thoughts continued to mull long after the dissertation was submitted. See references Feldman, 2008, for journal below.

_creative research_ Anthony Gormley - [reflections here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/189571628663/antony-gormley-exhibition-royal-academy), more photos [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/189571640423/antony-gormley-royal-academy-of-arts-2019-pt2). My reflections on Gormley notes that mechanics and technicalities are not essential to a piece - that the viewer experiences with all five senses, and often those that are not sight are overlooked (pardon the pun).

_creative research, material playing_ December was also a month of exploring and having a creative break. I attended a workshop run by (look back at messages of Olivia). Also some clay playing.

_reflection_ Also created a piece for a popup show on Personal Development, that ultimately was postponed, forever. This work was playing with development and how you measure it - a reflection of my own development for the dissertation was the ever increasing number of postit notes everywhere.

# **Jan 2020** 

_Creative Research_ January oh sweet unknowing jan - filled with many outings to art. Computation Arts Masters Pop up - Particularly liked Clemence Debaig's O'Clock [piece](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/621002587478573056/clemence-debaig-oclock), [thoughts on that](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190550307983/arebyte-residency-session-2-thoughts). 

_Creative Research_ Went to the Canary Wharf lights - [post](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190549043578/canary-wharf-winter-lights-went-to-the-winter), which although very commercial, was helpful in reaquainting myself with interactive physical digital art installations. I particularly liked Studio Chevalvert-Stratum's [installation](https://chevalvert.fr/en/projects/stratum), for its simplicity and easy interaction. It brought a big crowd, and there was something rather communal about watching a child control pulsing LEDs with their palm. This piece influenced my [Digital Performances piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1QE9HEGFvs) hugely.

Also paid a visit to the South London Gallery, where two pieces caught my eye [Annie Mackinnon - Compost Daddy - 2018](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190550064923/art-meganbenson-annie-mackinnon-compost-daddy) (below), and [Jonas Pequeno - Timeliner 2018](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190550069128/jonas-pequeno-timeliner-2018-south-london).

Evidence of planning and thinking about curation of the Degree Show [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190643900383/first-exhibition-planning-session) and [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190663921998/exhibition-planning-meeting-with-atau-502-notes)

Creative Research led me to the 5th Anniversary year for Novelty Automation, a small nook in london that houses many Arcade Machines and Automata by Tim Hunkins and others. It was _sublime_.  Reflections [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190697219748/novelty-automation-5th-yr-anniversary), some technical notes were that all his contraptions were very robust and contained, ready for the public to grab at and touch without its destruction. I think this is key to moving installations and yet is frustrating, as a good balance between robustness and delicacy seems impossible to reach.

_Technical research and planning_ While experimenting with flowers and learning Max for Digital Performances module, my mind was brainstorming extra layers for these blooming flowers. One of which was instagram filters - with Spark AR and augmented reality as a whole, it seems like a possible avenue of merging the virtual to the physical, which is often where my practice is drawn to. I was envisioning visitors being able to walk up to the piece and with instagram, (a platform that many have, so wouldn't have the bother of downloading a specific app just to interact with it), and see another layer of context, whether that be more information, or whether it be more abstract. 
I often think about the invisible data flows and signals that go around us, Takis seemed to feel the same way, making the focus of some of his pieces the space between the objects, the invisible magnetism holding them in place. With AR, the phone acts like a window into this magical invisible energy. 

Some _technical research_ [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190680538113/instagram-filter), for LEDs [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190697813098/controlling-led-strips-with-arduino-and-max), publishing the filter [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190771614413/publishing-an-instagram-filter), Video of the working tree filter [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190788095577/update-on-piece-workings-all-of-this-looks), I did not make the tree, I found it off a free 3D models site, but the hope was to create a model of my own to match the flowers.

Flower development and _iteration_. The final stage of this particular prototype ended badly, painting the paper mache petals was a poor decision (see below), but it did lead me to do some [more](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190788283883/mechanical-flower-egs) [and](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190790469313/more-trees-installations-blossom-timelapses) [more](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190788794153/big-tree-sculpture-egs) [research](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/190788405953/more-flower-egs) into making a better more functional, prettier flower to which I found the tutorial that would be tweaked for my final piece, thank you Jiri Praus.

_conceptual and creative research_ Somerset House 24/7 [Exhibition](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/247) on time and modern life, post [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/612597454750236672/pics-from-the-247-exhibition-at-somerset-house). The piece that stood out to me was Marcus Coates, Self Portrait as Time, 2016, ([here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/621071943009992705/art-meganbenson-somerset-house-247-exhibition)) he spends 12 hours following the second hand with his finger, giving the illusion that he is controlling time. Time is really interesting, in control and order. It crops up again now, as I collate this documentation in June, in lockdown, our perception of time has gone awry, physical displacement and a swift recalibration to the local, all normal timetabled structure out the window, leaving only endless present and it is both long and illuminating, and as swift as a tablecloth pulled off by a magician. [Time is also used heavily in prisons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smCA9UzDNpA), we no longer punish with physical beatings (well, not sentenced to them anyway), instead the worse the crime, the more time in a cage. Mentally, ex-convicts speak of having to take control of their own time as a method of survival.

Flower Progress, wire protyping two - 

Following Prous' tutorial. Lots of trial and error, turns out using heat shrink tubing instead of brass tubing is not so great when soldering wire flowers together. blog post [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/612597566967808000/flower-development).

# **May 2020** 

May consisted of Arebyte [hotting up](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/618552932762304512/wordpress-and-xampp-trials), lots of plastic [trials](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/618582602696228864/current-workings) and conceptual progress for flower. Looking at materiality and decay artists, blog post [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/619723744065241088/some-undeveloped-brainstorms).

Mechanical research - update progress here, with [mechanical flowers working](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/619722841389154304/mechanical-progress-thinking-through-the) and sorting out [this website](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/620461558076784640/using-github-pages-with-hugo-to-host-website).

May also consisted of my co-hosting an artist Q&A and [talk](https://www.gold.ac.uk/calendar/?id=13280)! Pushing myself out of my comfort zone massively - talking to lovely artists Loren Britton and Isabel Paehr about their duo project [MELTIONARY](http://meltionary.com/), looking at melting as a way of progressing, offering it as an alternative to deconstructing and starting a new, melting suggests a merging, squishing, evolving process, matter turning to different states with pressure and heat.

Stepper Motor, video of the stepper motor faltering [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/621087358913216512/stepper-motor-not-working-very-well-not-sure-why). I was advised that stepper motor would be better and more accurate, but because of the delicacy of the flowers and the size, it was a bit too clunky and loud, so I switched back to a normal servo.

# **June**

New technique on clay [here](https://megs2020degreeshowblog.tumblr.com/post/621090490738196480/new-technique-for-flower-doing-all-the-petals)

Planning and iterating around structural ideas, due to lack of scalability I thought that having hand to hold the flowers would be interesting, would also potentially give more human input into the composition, but it didn't look great and the conceptual development wasn't very strong so I scrapped it.
Also went through some trials around making molds for new cogs and teeth racks but they did not work - obviously, with hindsight.

## Creative research - What art/writing/ideas inspired the work ? 
## Technical research - Libraries/platforms you explored. Physical materials as well 
## Planning - Show us how you planned and adapted to unforeseen events 
Aesthetic choices - Show reasoned thought behind your decisions
------------------
There are a few strands of thought that play through the year: 
* Materials and their lifespan, grounding conceptual thinking with physical experimentation
* Art that provokes reflection
*

You should see something similar to the following written to the console. Note that the version here reflects the most recent version of Go as of the last update for this page:

```
Perhaps for questions
```

Next, make sure that you set up your `GOPATH` as described in the installation guide.

You can print the `GOPATH` with `echo $GOPATH`. You should see a non-empty string containing a valid path to your Go workspace; for example:

```
/Users/<yourusername>/Code/go
```
